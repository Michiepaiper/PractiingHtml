Americans are in a hurry. People from other countries regard this as our most singular characteristic. And they're right. It's a national trait arising from the questing, forceful energy that is our greatest source of strength.
But this same energy—this driving force that demands immediate action—can also be a source of weakness, for it has made us the most impatient people in the world. In times of war, many of our soldiers have found themselves at a fatal disadvantage due to their typically American impatience.

Frequently, they exposed themselves to fire unnecessarily instead of trying to outwit a sniper.
In business, the result can be the same. We want the contracts signed and the deals done, and we want them done now. We often fail to take the time to think a project through because of our bias toward action. Because of our impatience and in our haste to "get on with it," we may give away an important advantage to others who are willing to wait a little longer before taking action. Benjamin Franklin said, "He that can have patience can have what he will."
Patience demands its own peculiar type of courage. It's a persistent type of forbearance and fortitude that results from complete dedication to an ideal or goal. Patience is, as Browning said, the courage to change the things you can, the willingness to accept the things you cannot, and the wisdom to know the difference. Therefore, the more strongly you are imbued with the idea of achieving your principal goal in life, the more patience you will have to overcome obstacles.
